The goal is to predict the label of a text document based on its content. The app uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify the text documents.")
st.markdown("- Text Clustering: This is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar text documents together. The goal is to discover the underlying structure in the text data. The app uses the K-Means algorithm to cluster the text documents.")
